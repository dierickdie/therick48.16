A 4x12 + 4x4 ortho keyboard with USB C and SMD components. The 4x4 breaks away to just have 4x12

This is a Planck clone plus numpad with 19.05mm spacing (Planck uses 19mm).

This is a personal project to see if i could make a functioning PCB, and a huge thank you to Jack for his Planck design.

I am not an electrical engineer, and this is my first PCB that uses an integrated MCU. A double huge thank you to Nautilus in the ai03 discord for helping me work out the final tweaks.

**I AM CONSTANTLY TWEAKING THE DESIGN. I HAVE NOT ORDERED A PHYSICAL PCB YET.**

Although everything should<sup>(tm)</sup> work as is, it hasn't been physically tested, and I like playing with the traces to make it prettier/more efficient.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!** I am not responsible for any dumb things you do, fry your computer, break anything, etc.

## FAQ:
#### Does it have MIT?
No. Grid for life

#### Does it have backlighting?
No

#### Does it have RGB?
No

#### Does it have a rotary encoder?
No

#### Does it have hotswap?
No

#### Does it have Alps support?
No

#### Does it have Choc support?
No

#### Will you add any of these?
No

#### Why not?
I don't wanna

#### Why not use 19mm spacing like the Planck?
Cuz I dumb

#### Will you change it to 19mm spacing in the future?
Maybe? But probably not. See therick_19mm for that

#### Is the design finished?
Never

#### Did you steal the Rick artwork off the internet?
Yes

#### Why USB C?
That's a dumb question

#### Will you add micro/mini/any USB other than type C?
No

#### Why not?
USB C is the future. Until a new standard comes out

#### But I don't have any USB C cables.
Boo hoo. I suggest building one. Zap Cables is a good place to get parts

#### Why is it named therick64?
It started in fall of 2005 when I was just a boy. I started a new job, and needed a login name. The manager wrote The Rick (my first name is Rick). It has stuck ever since. Thanks, Sam! The 64 is for 64 keys, if that wasn't obvious.
